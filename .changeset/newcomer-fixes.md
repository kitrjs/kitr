Newcomer fixes. `kitr --version` (and `-v`) prints the version instead of "No version specified". `kitr doctor` no longer asks to list `@kitr/kitr` itself in kitrrc.ts. New projects' `biome.json` follows `.gitignore`. Prerendering with `crawlLinks` renders one page per path: `#anchor` links no longer re-render the same page or fill the sitemap with anchors. `kitr make:store` says in the generated file and AGENTS.md that the store needs its Provider for server rendering. `kitr --help` mentions that packages add their own commands inside a project.
