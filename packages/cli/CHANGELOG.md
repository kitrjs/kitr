### Minor Changes

- 9f0d0c4: `kitr dev`, `kitr build` and `kitr start` take `--filter=a,b` as another way to name the platforms (or workspace apps) to run.
- c7e8330: Initial release: the kitr framework, CLI, component registry and example kits.

### Patch Changes

- 3edf81d: Smaller browser bundles. A package can mark its provider `provider: { client: false }` and `@kitr/vite` leaves it out of the browser's provider list (cache, jobs, shield and uploads do); the devtools panels of every provider are dropped from production builds that do not ship `@kitr/devtools`. `kitr dev` names the generated type files it wrote with paths relative to the project.
